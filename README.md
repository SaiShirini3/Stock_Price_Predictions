### Stock_Price_Predictions


This repository contains the code for predicting stock prices using an LSTM model. The model is trained on a dataset of daily stock prices for the S&P 500 index. The model is then used to predict the stock price for the next day.

The code is written in Python using the PyTorch library. The model is a simple LSTM model with one hidden layer. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer.

The code is divided into the following sections:

* Data loading
* Data preprocessing
* Model definition
* Model training
* Model evaluation

The data loading section loads the stock price data from a CSV file. The data preprocessing section preprocesses the data by scaling it to between 0 and 1. The model definition section defines the LSTM model. The model training section trains the model on the data. The model evaluation section evaluates the model on the test data.
